## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS 12 or later
- Up Banking account with API access
- YNAB account with API access
- Swift 5.9+ (for building from source)

### Installation

### Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)

1. **Add the tap**
   ```bash
   brew tap swiftdevstuff/upynabsync
   ```

2. **Install UpYNABSync**
   ```bash
   brew install up-ynab-sync
   ```
3. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync --version
   ```

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swiftdevstuff/UpYNABSync.git
   cd UpYNABSync
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   swift build -c release
   ```

3. **Install the binary**
   ```bash
   cp .build/release/up-ynab-sync /usr/local/bin/
   ```

### Setup

1. **Set up API tokens**
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync auth
   ```
   You'll need:
   - Up Banking API token (from Up Banking app)
   - YNAB API token (from YNAB account settings)

2. **Configure account mappings**
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync config
   ```
   Map your Up Banking accounts to YNAB accounts through an interactive process.

3. **Perform your first sync**
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync sync
   ```

4. **Set up automatic syncing** (optional)
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync install
   ```

## üß† Merchant Learning & Auto-Categorization

UpYNABSync includes powerful AI-driven merchant learning capabilities that automatically categorize transactions based on patterns, making your budgeting workflow seamless and intelligent.

### ‚ú® Quick Start

Transform your transaction categorization in 4 simple steps:

1. **Learn from recent transactions**
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync learn
   ```
   Analyze your recent Up Banking transactions and interactively create categorization rules.

2. **Learn from existing YNAB patterns**
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync learn --from-ynab
   ```
   Analyze your existing YNAB categorization to automatically suggest rules.

3. **Enable auto-categorization**
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync config --categorization
   ```
   Configure auto-categorization settings including confidence thresholds.

4. **Sync with categorization**
   ```bash
   up-ynab-sync sync --categorize
   ```
   Apply categorization rules during sync for automatic transaction categorization.

### üéØ Managing Rules

**View and manage your categorization rules:**

```bash
# View all rules with usage statistics
up-ynab-sync rules --list

# View detailed statistics
up-ynab-sync rules --stats

# Add a new rule manually
up-ynab-sync rules --add "COLES" --category "Groceries"

# Remove a rule
up-ynab-sync rules --remove "COLES"

# Export rules for backup
up-ynab-sync rules --export my-rules-backup.json

# Import rules from backup
up-ynab-sync rules --import-file my-rules-backup.json
```

### üîç How It Works

The merchant learning system uses sophisticated pattern recognition:

1. **Pattern Extraction**: Extracts merchant patterns from transaction descriptions, removing noise like "CARD PURCHASE" and transaction IDs
2. **Smart Matching**: Matches transactions against your categorization rules using fuzzy matching
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Each match gets a confidence score based on pattern strength and historical accuracy
4. **Automatic Application**: High-confidence matches (‚â•70%) are automatically applied during sync
5. **Continuous Learning**: The system learns from your corrections and improves over time

### üí° Example Workflow

Here's how a typical merchant learning workflow looks:

```bash
# Start by learning from recent transactions
$ up-ynab-sync learn --days 14

# Interactive session begins
Processing transaction: -$67.50 from "COLES SUPERMARKET RICHMOND"
Detected pattern: COLES
Select category: Groceries

# Create rule and continue...
Rule created: COLES ‚Üí Groceries

# Learn from existing YNAB patterns
$ up-ynab-sync learn --from-ynab --days 60

# Found 15 potential patterns
Pattern 'SHELL' appears 8 times with 100% consistency in category 'Transport:Fuel'
Create rule? (y/n): y

# Enable auto-categorization
$ up-ynab-sync config --categorization
Auto-apply during sync? (y/n): y
Minimum confidence threshold (0.0-1.0): 0.7

# Sync with categorization
$ up-ynab-sync sync --categorize

# Results
‚úÖ Synced 12 transactions
üéØ Auto-categorized 8 transactions using merchant rules
üìä 3 new transactions ready for manual categorization
```

### üé® Advanced Usage

**Advanced learning options:**

```bash
# Learn from longer time periods
up-ynab-sync learn --from-ynab --days 90

# Auto-approve obvious patterns
up-ynab-sync learn --auto-approve

# Process more transactions in learning session
up-ynab-sync learn --limit 50

# Learn with verbose output
up-ynab-sync learn --verbose
```

**Advanced rule management:**

```bash
# View detailed rule statistics
up-ynab-sync rules --stats --verbose

# Export rules with metadata
up-ynab-sync rules --export --include-stats

# Remove unused rules
up-ynab-sync rules --cleanup
```

### üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local-only processing**: All pattern analysis and learning happens on your device
- **No cloud services**: Your financial data never leaves your machine
- **Secure storage**: Rules stored in encrypted local database
- **Open source**: Full transparency - you can audit the code yourself
